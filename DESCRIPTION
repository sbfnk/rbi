Description: Provides a complete R interface to LibBi, a library for Bayesian inference (see <http://libbi.org> for more information). This includes functions for manipulating LibBi models, for reading and writing LibBi input/output files, for converting LibBi output to provide traces for use with the coda package, and for running LibBi from R.
