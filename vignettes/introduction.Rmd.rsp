[RBi](https://github.com/libbi/RBi) is an `R` interface to [LibBi](http://libbi.org), a library for Bayesian inference with state-space models using high-performance computer hardware.

### Latest Version: _0.6.0_

The package has been tested on macOS/OSX and Linux. It requires a working installation of **LibBI**, which is easiest done using the [homebrew-science](http://brew.sh/homebrew-science/) tap: Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) (on OS X) or [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh) (on linux), then issue the following commands (using a command shell, i.e. Terminal or similar):

```{sh eval=FALSE}
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install libbi
```

If you have any trouble installing **LibBi** you can get help on the [LibBi Users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/libbi-users) mailing list.

The path to the `libbi` script can be passed as an argument to **RBi**, otherwise the package tries to find it automatically using the `which` linux/unix command.

If you just want to process the output from **LibBi**, then you do not need to have **LibBi** installed.

# Installation

The **RBi** package requires `R` (>= 3.2.0) as well as the packages:

- `reshape2`
- `ncdf4`
- `data.table`

The easiest way to install the latest stable version of **RBi** is via CRAN. The package name is `rbi` (all lowercase):

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('rbi')
```

Alternatively, the current development version can be installed using the `devtools` package

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
library('devtools')
install_github("libbi/rbi")
```

# Loading the package

Use

```{R}
library('rbi')
```
to load the package.

# Getting started

The main computational engine and model grammar behind **RBi** is provided by **LibBi**. The [LibBi manual](http://libbi.org/docs/LibBi-Manual.pdf) is a good place to start for finding out everything there is to know about **LibBi** models and inference methods.

The **RBi** package mainly provides two classes: `bi_model` and `libbi`. The `bi_model` class is used to load, view and manipulate **LibBi** model files. The `libbi` class is used to run LibBi and perform inference.

The package also provides two methods for interacting with the [NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) files used by **LibBi**, `bi_read` and `bi_write`. Lastly, it provides a `get_traces` function to analyse Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) traces using the [coda](https://cran.r-project.org/package=coda) package.

# The `bi_model` class

As an example, we consider a simplified version of the SIR model discussed in [Del Moral et al. (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4081). This is included with the **RBi** package and can be loaded with

```{R}
model_file <- system.file(package="rbi", "SIR.bi") # get full file name from package
SIRmodel <- bi_model(model_file) # load model
```

The `SIRmodel` object now contains the model, which can be displayed with

```{R}
SIRmodel
```

A part of the model can be shown with, for example,

```{R}
SIRmodel[35:38]
```

or

```{R}
get_block(SIRmodel, "parameter")
```

To get a list of states, you can use

```{R}
var_names(SIRmodel, "state")
```

Moreover, there are various methods for manipulating a model, such as `remove`, `insert`, `replace`, `rename`.

The `fix` method fixes a variable to one value. This can be useful, for example, to run the deterministic equivalent of a stochastic model for testing purposes.

To get documentation for any of these methods, use the links in the documentation for `bi_model`.

# Generating a dataset

First, let's create a data set from the SIR model.

```{R}
SIRdata <- bi_generate_dataset(SIRmodel, end_time=16*7, noutputs=16, seed=12345678)
```

This simulates the model a single time from time 0 until time 16*7 (e.g., 16 weeks with a daily time step), producing 16 output (one a week). Note that we have specified a seed to make this document reproducible. Remove the `seed` argument or specify a different seed to simulate your own data set.

The `bi_generate_dataset` function returns a `libbi` object:

```{R}
SIRdata
```

Note that, if no `working_folder` is specified, the model and output files will be stored in a temporary folder.

The generated dataset can be viewed and/or stored in a variable using `bi_read`:

```{R}
dataset <- bi_read(SIRdata)
```

The `bi_read` function takes the name of a NetCDF file or a `libbi` object (in which case it locates the output file) and stores the contents in a list of data frames or vectors, depending on the dimensionality of the contents:

```{R}
names(dataset)
dataset$p_R0
dataset$Incidence
```

We can visualise the generated incidence data with

```{R}
plot(dataset$Incidence$time, dataset$Incidence$value)
```

# The `libbi` class

The `libbi` class manages the interaction with **LibBi** such as sampling from the prior or posterior distribution.

```{R}
bi <- libbi(SIRmodel)
```

This initialises a `libbi` object called `bi` with the model created earlier.

Let's sample from the prior of the SIR model:

```{R}
sample(bi, target="prior", nsamples=1000, end_time=16*7, noutputs=16)
```

This step calls **LibBi** to sample from the prior distribution of the previously specified model, generating 1,000 samples and each time running the model for 16 * 7 = 112 time steps and writing 16 outputs (i.e., every 7 time steps). **LibBi** parses the model, creates C++ code, compiles it and run the model. If the model is run again, it should do so much quicker because it will will use the already compiled C++ code to run the model:

```{R}
sample(bi)
```

Any call of `sample` preserves options passed to the previous call of `sample` and `libbi`, unless they are overwritten by arguments passed to `sample` (e.g., passing a new `nsamples` argument). Let's have a closer look at the `bi` object:

```{R}
str(bi)
```

We can see it contains 12 fields: `client` is the client we passed (see LibBi manual for other clients, e.g. `filter`); `config` allows to specify an external configuration file; the `options` field contains all the options we passed to `bi$run`

```{R}
bi$options
```

The other fields contain various bits of information about the object, including the model used, the command used to run **LibBi** (`bi$command`) and the output file name:

```{R}
bi$output_file_name
```

We can get the results of the sampling run using `bi_read`

```{R}
prior <- bi_read(bi$output_file_name)
```

or with the shorthand

```{R}
prior <- bi_read(bi)
```

which looks at the `output_file_name` field to read in the data. Let's look at the returned object

```{R}
str(prior)
```

This is a list of 11 objects, 10 representing each of the (noise/state) variables and parameters in the file, and one number `clock`, representing the time spent running the model in milliseconds.

We can see that the time-varying variables are represented as data frames with three columns: `np` (enumerating individual simulations), `time` and `value`. Parameters don't vary in time and just have `np` and `value` columns.

# Fitting a model to data using PMCMC

Let's perform inference using Particle Markov-chain Metropolis Hastings (PMMH). The following command will generate 16 * 10,000 = 160,000 simulations and therefore may take a little while to run (if you want to see the samples progress, use `verbose=TRUE` in the `bi$run` call).

```{R}
seed <- generate_seed()
bi <- sample(bi,target="posterior", nparticles=16, obs=SIRdata, sample_obs=TRUE, nsamples=10000, seed=seed)
bi$options$seed
```

This samples from the posterior distribution. Remember that options are preserved from previous runs, so we don't need to specify `nsamples`, `end_time` and `noutputs` again, unless we want to change them. The same holds for `seed`, which is why we set it to a (pseudo-)random value as returned by the random generator of **R** using `generate_seed`. An alternative would have been to set `bi$option$seed` to NULL and let **LibBi** set the random seed, but then we could not have inspected it afterwards. The `nparticles` option specifies the number of particles, and the `sample_obs` option tells the `sample` command that we also want observation samples from the posterior distribution of trajectories. 

Input, init and observation files (see the [LibBi manual](http://libbi.org/docs/LibBi-Manual.pdf) for details) can be specified using the `init`, `input`, `obs` options, respectively. They can each be specified either as the name of a NetCDF file containing the data (i.e., a character vector of length one, a `libbi` object (in which case the output file will be taken), or a list of data frames or numeric vectors). In the case of the command above, `init` is specified as a list, and `obs` as a `libbi` object. The `Incidence` variable of the `SIRdata` object will be taken as observations. 

The time dimension (or column, if a data frame) in the passed `init`, `input` and/or `obs` files can be specified using the `time_dim` option. If this is not given, it will be assumed to be `time`, if such a dimension exists or, if not, any numeric column not called `value` (or the contents of the `value_column` option). If this does not produce a unique column name, an error will be thrown. All other dimensions/columns in the passed options will be interpreted as additional dimensions in the data, and stored in the `dims` field of the `libbi` object.

Any other options (apart from `log_file_name`, see the [Debugging](#debugging) section) will be passed on to the command `libbi` -- for a complete list, see the [LibBi manual](http://libbi.org/docs/LibBi-Manual.pdf). Hyphens can be replaced by underscores so as not to confuse R (see `end_time`). Any arguments starting with `enable`/`disable` can be specified as boolean (e.g., `assert=TRUE`). Any `dry-` options can be specified with a `"dry"` argument, e.g., `parse="dry"`.

# Analysing an MCMC run

Let's get the results of the preceding `sample` command:

```{R}
bi_contents(bi)
posterior <- bi_read(bi)
str(posterior)
```

To get a summary of the parameters sampled, use
```{R}
summary(posterior)
```

We can see that this has three more objects than previously when we specified `target="prior"`: `loglikelihood` (the estimated log-likelihood of the parameters at each MCMC step), `logprior` (the estimated log-prior density of the parameters at each MCMC step), and `Incidence` (sampled observations, as we specified `sample_obs=TRUE`).

To analyse MCMC outputs, we can use the **coda** package and the `get_traces` function of **RBi**. Note that, to get exactly the same traces, you would have to use the seed randomly generated above.

```{R}
library(coda)
traces <- mcmc(get_traces(bi))
```

We can study, for example, the acceptance rate

```{R}
accRate <- 1 - rejectionRate(traces)
accRate
```

and visualise parameter traces and densities with

```{R fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
plot(traces)
```

Compare this to the marginal posterior distributions to the "correct" parameters used to generate the data set:

```{R}
dataset[bi$model$get_vars("param")]
```

For more details on using **coda** to further analyse the chains, see the website of the [coda package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=coda). For more plotting functionality, see the `plot_libbi` function in [RBi.helpers](https://github.com/sbfnk/rbi.helpers).

# Debugging

If `libbi` throws an error, it is best to investigate with `verbose = TRUE`, and setting `working_folder` to a folder that one can then use for debugging. Output of the `libbi` call can be saved in a file using the `log_file_name` option (by default a temporary file).

# Related packages
