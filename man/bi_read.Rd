bi_read(
  x,
  vars,
  dims,
  model,
  type,
  file,
  missval_threshold,
  coord_dims = list(),

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{either a path to a NetCDF file, or a NetCDF connection created using
\code{nc_open}, or a \code{\link{libbi}} object from which to read the
output}

\item{vars}{variables to read; if not given, all will be read}

\item{dims}{factors for dimensions}

\item{model}{model file or a \code{bi_model} object (if \code{x} is not a
\code{libbi} object)}

\item{type}{vector of types of variable to read (out of "param", "state",
"noise", "obs"). This needs 'x' to be a \code{\link{libbi}} object or
\code{model} to be specified}

\item{file}{which file to read (if \code{x} is given as a \code{\link{libbi}}
object): one of "output" (default), "init", "input", "obs"}

\item{missval_threshold}{upper threshold for the likelihood}

\item{coord_dims}{any \code{coord} dimensions, given as a named list of
character vectors, where each element corresponds to the variable of the
same name, and the character vector are the \code{coord} dimensions}

\item{thin}{thinning (keep only 1/thin of samples)}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE, will print variables as they are read}

\item{clear_cache}{if TRUE, will clear the cache and re-read the file even if
cached data exists}

\item{init_to_param}{logical; if TRUE, convert states to initial values}

\item{burn}{number of initial samples to discard; default: 0}
}
\value{
a list of data frames and/or numbers that have been read
}
\description{
This function reads all variable from a NetCDF file or the output of a
\code{\link{libbi}} object.
The file can be specified as a string to the filepath, in which
case a NetCDF connection is opened, or directly as a NetCDF connection.

example_output_file <- system.file(package = "rbi", "example_output.nc")
